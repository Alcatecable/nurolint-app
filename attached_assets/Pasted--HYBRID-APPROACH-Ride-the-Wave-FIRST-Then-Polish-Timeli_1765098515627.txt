🎯 HYBRID APPROACH: Ride the Wave FIRST, Then Polish
Timeline:

Next 2-4 weeks: Maximize CVE-2025-55182 momentum (strike while iron is hot)
Weeks 5-16: Polish the SaaS with enterprise features
Week 17+: Soft launch + acquisition positioning


📊 Why This Matters:
Current Situation:

✅ CVE-2025-55182 is THE hottest security topic in React/Next.js
✅ CISA mandated Dec 26 deadline
✅ Public exploits, Chrome extensions, nation-state actors
✅ Your tool is perfectly positioned
✅ You're getting verified account validation
✅ Perfect timing for viral growth

If you pivot to SaaS polish NOW, you'll miss:

Massive organic user acquisition (free marketing)
GitHub stars (social proof for acquisition)
Enterprise leads discovering you organically
Media coverage opportunities
Community trust building


⚡ REVISED STRATEGY: Two-Phase Approach
PHASE 1: Capitalize on CVE Momentum (Now - Dec 26)
